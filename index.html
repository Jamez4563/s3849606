				<h3>Introducing myself</h3>
			</header>
				<p>Hello, my name is Shuo Zhou. You can just call me James! My family are from Shanghai, China however I was born in Australia, this year I am turning 19.</p>
				<p>I went to Glen Waverley Secondary College in 2019, first year at RMIT doing Bachelor of Information Technology. I have had online lessons regarding IT but during early 2019 I didn't know if I would pursue this, turns out I did want to.</p>
				<p>Fun fact about me, I am actually 3/4 blind. I was born with a condition called <a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/stargardt-disease">Stargardt Disease.</a></p>
				<p>That is why you may see me look extremely close to things, since I had an injury to my right eye, I primarily use my left eye. So I may tilt my head to get a better angle. </p>
				<p>If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.</p>

					<h3>Interests in Information Technology</h3>
					<p>It all started when I was around 15 years old, since I am visually impaired I knew I couldn't drive a vehicle without the aid of AI. At that time, I wanted to do IT but didn't ahve the courage to pursue as it might have been difficult for me due to vision.</p>
					<p>I kept up with all technology from small devices to large vehicles and found them extremely interesting, utnil I started coding and scripting for some friends on a game, doing game development really sparked me and I began to love IT more than ever, it wasn't until I met a fully blind coder, which gave me inspiration to pursue my dream.</p>
					<p> My dream was to create assistive technology for disabled individuals, suhc as myself to reduce any inconvenience, for the next year I wathc online lessons and read documents on different type of coding.</p>
					<p>Later that year I was involved in an accident which left me stuck in bed for a month, I lost interest in IT until I started to watch car videos, more specifically tesla videos on YouTube</p>
					<p>During my time at RMIT, I wish to obtain the skills and knowledge required to enter the IT department, and develop any assistive apps or technology for people with disabilities.</p>

To me, coding in general is interesting. </p>

					<h3>Profile</h2>
					<p>While there I don't have formal education in philosophy it is very much an interest of mine.</p>
					<p>Always interested in reading and learning more! I can not recommend having another interest enough outside of Information Technology. Such development and passion in other areas can only benefit you more.</p>

			<p>Really anything that continues to push me further...</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
			I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
