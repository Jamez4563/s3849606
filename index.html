				<h2>Introducing myself</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Hello, my name is Shuo Zhou. You can just call me James! My family are from Shanghai, China however I was born in Australia, this year I am turning 19.</p>
				<p>I went to Glen Waverley Secondary College in 2019, first year at RMIT doing Bachelor of Information Technology. I have had online lessons regarding IT but during early 2019 I didn't know if I would pursue this, turns out I did want to.</p>
				<p>Fun fact about me, I am actually 3/4 blind. I was born with a condition called <a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/stargardt-disease">Stargardt Disease.</a></p>
				<p>That is why you may see me look extremely close to things, since I had an injury to my right eye, I primarily use my left eye. So I may tilt my head to get a better angle. </p>
				<p>If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.</p>				<p>Student ID: s3849606</p>

					<h2>Interests in Information Technology</h2>
					<p>It all started when I was around 15 years old, since I am visually impaired I knew I couldn't drive a vehicle without the aid of AI. At that time, I wanted to do IT but didn't ahve the courage to pursue as it might have been difficult for me due to vision.</p>
					<p>I kept up with all technology from small devices to large vehicles and found them extremely interesting, utnil I started coding and scripting for some friends on a game, doing game development really sparked me and I began to love IT more than ever, it wasn't until I met a fully blind coder, which gave me inspiration to pursue my dream.</p>
					<p> My dream was to create assistive technology for disabled individuals, suhc as myself to reduce any inconvenience, for the next year I wathc online lessons and read documents on different type of coding.</p>
					<p>Later that year I was involved in an accident which left me stuck in bed for a month, I lost interest in IT until I started to watch car videos, more specifically tesla videos on YouTube</p>
					<p>During my time at RMIT, I wish to obtain the skills and knowledge required to enter the IT department, and develop any assistive apps or technology for people with disabilities.</p>

					<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
					<p>I am also interested in finance, which lead me to choose <a bref="https://www.adzuna.com.au/details/1501137126?se=DAoZioRx6hGlWoB1gz0_hg&v=57A78C851D8870839F42C18F75A17E0D07C9DE01">Senior Developer </a> at a buisness which creates apps for financial buisnesses. To me, coding in general is interesting. </p>
					<p>This job requires that we create new interfaces, features and implenting bug fixes to the application. We would be working alongside the Head of Technology and Head if Product to discusss issues, risks and monitor the overall progress. </p>
					<p>The job asks that I am experienced with AWS, experienced using modern source control, an experienced/strong background in IT,  able to work with high levels of automation, good communication skills and able to work with Javascript, Node.js, Golong, AWS, Ruby as well as assistive technology implementation for the web development.</p>
					<p>To make this job possible, I would need to study hard for all my IT subjects. More specifically, practical database, programming and information technology. I would need to be experienced with various languages in coding, which is where Programming comes into play. I would need to register to be enrolled in Mobile app development, as the interface involves not only apps but also websites, which will be covered in Introduction to Information Technology.</p>

					<p>According to the <a bref="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=8&V=8&T=4">test results</a>, I am 40% Auditory leaner, 40% Visual learner and 20% tactile learner. </p>

					<p>The <a bref="https://www.educations.com/quizzes/what-type-of-student-are-you-13954">'What type of student are you?' quiz</a> shows that I am a <a bref="https://gyazo.com/8359355617b9be56f12c27801f7751b1">social butterfly</a>.</p>
					<p>Small reflection</p>
					<p>From the test results above, I do believe some of them may be correct but at the same time some are innaccurate. However, there are things that I believe I should learn from, sucha s beign a social butterfly isn't neccessarily bad but to me I want to focus more on studies rather than having a giant friendship circle. As for the perosnality test, I do believe it is going to influence me, and may even motivate me as now I know what type of person I am. </p>

					<p><b>Overview</b></p>
					<p>This project will be an assistive technology app, aimed towards users who have a disability. The aim is for the app to first be compatible on both google play and app store. The pp will have multiple functions such as being able to zoom in far more than the regular phone camera, through the use of AI it will help make the picture more clear and through coding it will reduce motion on a digital side, in other words increase a digital optical image stabilisation. The app shall also consist of being able to scan text and reformat to an alternative format accessible by low vision users, it shall also be able to convert the text to speech for users who have no sense of hearing. </p>
					<p><b>Motivation</b></p>
					<p>As a vision impaired user myself, I find it hard to read text in different fonts and sizes, I often encounter situations where I just cannot see the sign or light so will resort to using my phone. Many times, the phone camera is not enough as it is not built for accessibility purposes. When reading books or documentation, it is very hard to read anything, it takes me a lot less time to just listen to the audio of the document at a higher rate of speed, which is why I think that many users regardless if deaf, blind or any other disability, will find this program extremely useful. I do have something similar, but it just isn’t as convenient as all purposes are split into different apps, so I need to keep switching for the right function. </p>
					<p><b>Description</b></p>
					<p>The app would have several capabilities, such as changing the theme of the text after scanning, such as invert colours, Yellow on Black, White on Black, etc. It would have an option to speed up the rate of speech, for those users who rely on audio formats, the ability to change the voice style from different audio files. Have an inbuilt camera function using the phones back cameras, have a built in AI to help stabilise and help make the picture clearer, through the technology the app would be using multiple functions to provide a clear result. Such as, if taking a photo of very small text, the app would use its scan, camera, digital optical image stabilisation functionalities to combine all three data into one set of data which would be a result picture. The app would have the ability to pair up hearing aids and customise noise levels and different frequencies to ensure that the user is comfortable while using the program. The app would also have an inbuilt ‘night mode’ function built into the camera, what this will do is act as a brightener for the picture if taking photos late at night or in a dark environment. As far as brightening the image, it cannot go as far due to a physical capability of the lens, however the app would be able to use the previous data set from all three functions and add an additional function which would shift the automatic focus of the camera and turn it off. Then import various tools to increase the brightness of the photo after storing the photo in the phone’s storage. Touching back to the alternative formats, the app would have present formats which are easier to read, such as bolded, or less points and more curves. This would also include the ability to change font colour, font size as well as font thickness manually. If editing the scanned document, it would have a present curser for typing which can be adjusted through a horizontal slider to decrease and increase the thickness of the curser for visibility. </p>
					<p><b>Tools and Technology</b></p>
					<p>The app is intended to be built for android and iOS devices, however taking into all the functions that will be running simultaneously, it would require a phone with a recent processor as it would require a bit of RAM and processing power from the processor. The app is planned to eb built in a mobile app creator such as MIT App Inventor and is planned to eb coded completely out of JavaSCript or Python. </p>
					<p><b>Skills Required</b></p>
					<p> In order for the program to come to life, it would require people who have lots aof experience and a deep understanding in JavaScript or Python. Their expertise would need to eb JavaScript or Python. The app would need to also be coded so that it can be easily updated and patched without having to edit several parts, variables would need to be heavy descriptive to reduce any confusion and no space for error. </p>
					<p><b>Outcome</b></p>
					<p>If this program was finished, I know it would be heavily beneficial as not only me, but when I attended a program specialised for teenagers with vision or hearing impairment, they all had a similar view that there is no app that can really multi-task wiothoiut having to carry around a heavy goggle system. This app would resolve issues such as communication for disabled individuals, allow them to travel independently as all their assistive technology needs are right there inside one aphtha app however can be used by individuals who may not even have a disability, as it is so assistive feature rich, it could even benefit a regular person who may have forgotten their glasses or is simple too tired to read but would rather liste on the train or while walking. </p>
